# Image Location Detector (ILD) Application
This project was created to raise awareness about the importance of turning off location tags to maintain user privacy and security. We also utilize exiftool to reveal the location of the user through photos. 
# How It Works?
This application works by extracting metadata from an uploaded image, then retrieving geolocation tags to visualize where the photo was taken in the form of maps.
